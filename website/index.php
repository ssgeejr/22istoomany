	to. This site is dedicated to bringing that level of commitment to our 
	military's Active, Reserve, National Guard and Veterans. We have a long way 
	to go to get there.</p>
      <p>Twenty-two veterans and 1 active duty soldier commit suicide on a daily 
	  basis. These numbers are based on a military study done in 2012 [<a href="http://www.va.gov/opa/docs/suicide-data-report-2012-final.pdf">PDF Report</a>]</p>
      <p>Even with a heavier online presence to help support our military 
	  personnel, nothing has reduced the the nasty backlog that is overwhelming 
	  the VA doctors and hospitals. <em>More than 238,000 of the 847,000 
	  veterans with pending applications for health care through the Department 
	  of Veterans Affairs have already died, according to an internal VA 
	  document released April of 2015.</em> [<a href="http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/DeathAnalyses2015.pdf">PDF Report</a>]</p>
      <p> The latest government military suicide report, which was released in 
	  August, covers the first two quarters of 2015. It's not a positive report 
	  to look at. The overall stats are disappointing [<a href="http://www.dspo.mil/Portals/113/Documents/DoD%20Quarterly%20Suicide%20Report%20CY2015%20Q2.pdf">PDF Report</a>]</p>
      <p>Don't wait to make a positive impact on the soldiers and veterans you 
	  encounter. You just might save someone's life.</p></td>
